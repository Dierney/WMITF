When you read the tooltip on a modded item, WMITF will show you the name of the mod which it came from.

This can be useful if you're playing with lots of mods at once, or if you're a YouTuber and you want your viewers to see which mods you're using.

In the future, I might add similar functionality for tiles and NPCs.
